# Clever Clipboard
This application allows you to have stack of clipboard's records.

## Explanation
When you are copying some information it is shifting to nominal data structure that contains the history of your clipboard work. Moving in the past records is from top to bottom. So the penult entry will be the first when the clever clipboard is applied.

## Restriction
The application doesn't have the functionality to change hotkeys and works only on windows. 

## Usage
It is important to know that moving over the buffer doesn't mean inserting the previous record.

The main hotkeys:
- To move down along your history of copy-paste just press the hotkey - Alt + V
- To clear the history - Alt + Delete
